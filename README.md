# Tabletop Simulator EmmyLua Types

The current official release of EmmyLua is a good foundation, however it's lacking the functionality necessary to type anything beyond the most simple code.

I've added a _heap_ of functionality to EmmyLua, and these types are reliant on these [new features](https://github.com/EmmyLua/IntelliJ-EmmyLua/pull/342). As such you will need my fork of EmmyLua rather than the version officially available from Jetbrains.
